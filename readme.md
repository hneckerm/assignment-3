>Here I am, remaking [the p'unk ave website](http://www.punkave.com) from scratch as best I can.

I downloaded the original stylesheet, but there are a lot of psuedo-selectors involved, as well as javascript frameworks. thus it was very difficult to replicate a lot of the layout.

### Some notes on various struggles:
> it was difficult to position the text correctly on the gallery images. I was able to get them working when I reworked the divs into tables, but the punk website doesn't utilize tables. so I settled for the basic gist here, would appreciate any pointers to make it look cleaner! 
>
> the nav id also looks poorly on mobile/resized browser size. original nav on p'unk
website uses a javascript extension (Bootstrap, I think but not sure) so there was
no good way for me to replicate this for mobile without a lot more code.
>
> the background #banner is part of a moving image and I was only able to save a
captured version of it. what you're seeing when you compare it to the P'unk 
website may or may not be different.
